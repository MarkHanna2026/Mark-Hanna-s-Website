                <h3>A little about me</h3>
                <p>My name is Mark Hanna. I am 23 years old and originally from Tanta, Egypt. I currently live in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. 
                   I moved to the U.S. in 2013, initially settling in Jersey City, New Jersey. In 2018, I relocated to Framingham, Massachusetts, 
                   where I completed my high school education. I then attended MassBay Community College, studying sociology and psychology. 
                   However, near the completion of my degree, I decided to switch to Information Technology. After exploring multiple universities, 
                   I chose UMass Boston.
                </p>
