            <!--History About UMass Boston-->
            <h2>History About UMass Boston</h2>
            <p>Before 1964, Massachusetts's only public university was in Amherst, 
               originally founded as Massachusetts
               The Agricultural College was established in 1863 and later became UMass in 1947. With the surge of baby boomer
               applicants in the 1960s, UMass lacked space, rejecting many qualified Boston-area students who
               couldn't afford private education. Recognizing the need for an affordable urban university,
               Massachusetts legislators established UMass Boston in June 1964. The university opened in 1965 in Park
               Square with 1,227 students. In 1968, plans were made to relocate to Columbia Point in Dorchester, 
               and the new campus opened in 1974. Then the founding of the College of Nursing and Health Sciences, the College of Management, 
               and the John W. McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies are major turning points. In the 2010s and 2020s, 
               the campus saw major improvements that included new residence halls, academic buildings, and infrastructural upgrades. 
               By 2025, UMass Boston was still a research-focused, diversified university that responded to a large student body and was 
               dedicated to the environment, social justice, and urban education. Its standing as a leader in community service and public 
               education only grew.
