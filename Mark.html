               <!--About me-->
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am Mark Hanna. I am 23 years old. I am from Tanta, Egypt. I came to the United States of 
               America at the end of 2013 in New Jersey, Jersey City. I speak, write, and read English and 
               Arabic very fluently. My hobbies are drawing, listening to music, driving cars, and motorcycles. 
               Driving at night while drinking Red Bull is my favorite thing in the world. For me, technology 
               is a way of life because it always evolving and I like to learn new things every day. 
               This is what keeps life interesting for me: you never stop learning. 
            </p>
            <!--My educational background-->
            <h3>My educational background</h3>
            <p>When I came to the United States of America at the end of 2013, I joined middle school at PS#17 in the 
               middle of the 7th grade. I finished middle school in June 2015. I joined high school at James J. Ferris. 
               Then left after I finished my junior year in June 2018. Then for my last year of high school, 
               I joined Framingham High School and graduated in June 2019. Then I joined the Massachusetts College of 
               Pharmacy and Health Sciences, I enrolled in the dental hygiene program, and after one semester 
               I dropped the first week and took two years to figure out what I wanted to study for my future. Then I joined MassBay Community 
               College in September 2021 and studied sociology and psychology. 
               Left MassBay Community College in May 2023 and joined the University of Massachusetts 
               Boston in September 2023 and expected to graduate in May 2026. 
            </p>
            <!--Why I Joined UMass Boston-->
            <h4>Why I Joined UMass Boston</h4>
            <p>I joined UMass Boston for a lot of reasons. First, the high-quality learning you get at UMass Boston. For example, hands-on projects, 
               teamwork, labs, course materials, and professional professors using their real-world experience to implement their course material, 
               which helps prepare the students. The college of management attracted me since I got to learn some business management and some 
               Technology along with the track's choices. Which was my goal. The many sports programs and clubs that embrace any culture. 
               Cost is one of the most important things because I come from the middle class, averaging 10,000 a semester, which is pretty good 
               compared to other colleges. Convince in class time you have morning, afternoon, and evening classes along with Beacon 
               flex, which offers either virtual or in-person class hosting. This is essential for me because I work full-time, and having many 
               options like this is very convincing for me. Also, there are always events on campus which make it fun and interesting. 
               Lastly, the counseling is free, which makes me feel comfortable finding resources on campus if I feel stressed or want to 
               talk to someone, as well as it shows the university cares deeply about the students and their mental well-being. 
               Overall, everything I want in a university, you, UMass Boston, got it.       
            </p>
            <!--Achievement, plans, goals-->

            <p>My achievements in MassBay Community College are Spring 2022, fall 2022, and Spring 2023. 
               All these semesters put me on the dean's list with a GPA of 3.7. 
               Then I joined the national honor society Phi Theta Kappa. 
               For UMass Boston, spring 2024, and fall 2024, I made it to the dean's list with a 3.7 GPA.
               Plans, I am planning to finish my bachelor's degree in information technology in May 2026.

               Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE), Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA). While pursuing my master's.
               My goal after completing my bachelor's get these certifications is to become an expert in 
               AWS, Azure, VMware, and Linux. To become an expert in system administration. 
               After these certifications and my master's completed, and gained the 
               experience to be able to teach and inspire college students and help the future of 
               IT students to become the best in their careers.  
            </p>
            <!--Why, and How I choose IT-->
            <h6>Why, and How I choose IT</h6>
            <p>First, I have been passionate about technology since I was a kid. My uncle has introduced me to technology 
               such as how computers work, and Windows. He used to teach a lot about these things. Anyone asked me when 
               I was young what I wanted when I grew up I said, computer engineer because I did not know much about careers. 
               All I know is that something had to do with computers. When it came to college time, the reason why I was in sociology, and 
               psychology was that I was working full time and supporting my family, thus I thought I couldn't approach anything in 
               tech since I did not have time to study, and I was wrong. During the spring of 2024, I looked at the progress I made in my
               major in sociology and psychology, and I held a 3.7 GPA.  Why not approach something I am passionate about? After deep looking 
               into tech fields such as computer science and information technology. I chose Information technology because it a one 
               of the fastest-growing tech fields, technology is always evolving, I am passionate about it, it pays a good salary, 
               you could never get bored in this field, and you always learning new things.
